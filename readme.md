# In-site Shortkeys

With **In-site Shortkeys**, you can define custom keyboard shortcuts for certain actions of websites you use frequently.

It is possible to define shortcuts for executing scripts. You can also share these script shortkeys with all sites.

You can export your custom shortkeys and share it with your friend or your teammate.

You can determine any combination of keys. Here are some examples of possibilities:

- `k`
- `ctrl + shift + e`
- `alt + ctrl + shift + u`
- `a + b`
- `1 + 2 + 3`
- `shift + %`


**Notice:**
- You can't override some of the browser-reserved keyboard shortcuts. e.g `ctrl + t`, `ctrl + n`, `ctrl + shift + n`, `ctrl + w`, `ctrl + shift + n` and a few other keys.
